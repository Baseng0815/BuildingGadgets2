**NOTE ON RUBIDIUM**
Rubidium contains code that will crash many mods when used in conjunction with them. Unfortunately this includes Building Gadgets 2. There is absolutely nothing I can do on my side to prevent these crashes. If you're using Rubidium and your game crashes when rendering something, please try without rubidium before submitting a bug report.
